# Overview

I have developed a series of test that you are able to run. This is just to demonstrate the rust language, as prior to this project, I did not know anything about it. The other part of the program is a guessing game. It randomly has a number 1-100, and you have 5 tries to guess it.

I wrote this software to learn more about the rust language. How to receive inputs, use mutable and immutable variables, etc.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code and the rust extension.

I had to add the random library to the code, so I could generate a random number.
